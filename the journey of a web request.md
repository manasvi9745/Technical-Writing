# The Journey of a Web Request

When you type a URL in your browser and press Enter, a fascinating journey begins. Let's break down this journey step by step.

## 1. DNS Resolution
- The browser first needs to find the actual IP address of the server
- It checks various DNS caches (browser, operating system, router)
- If not found in caches, it queries DNS servers
- Finally gets the IP address of the server

**TODO:** Add explanation of DNS cache hierarchy and time complexity of DNS lookups

## 2. Establishing TCP Connection
- The browser initiates a TCP connection with the server
- This happens through the famous three-way handshake:
  - **TODO:**Complete the three-way handshake

**TODO:** Add details about TCP window sizing and congestion control algorithms

## 3. TLS Handshake (for HTTPS)
- After TCP connection, a secure channel needs to be established
- Client and server exchange certificates
- They negotiate encryption algorithms
- A secure connection is established

## 4. HTTP Request Formation
- Browser creates an HTTP request with the following components:
# HTTP Request Components

## HTTP Methods
HTTP methods define the intended action for a request:

### GET
- Retrieves resources from the server
- Cannot include a request body
- Data sent through URL parameters only
- Example: `GET /api/products`

### POST
- Submits data to create new resources
- Includes data in request body
- Example: `POST /api/users`

### PUT
- Updates existing resources completely
- Includes full resource in body
- Example: `PUT /api/users/123`

### DELETE
- Removes specified resources
- Typically no body needed
- Example: `DELETE /api/users/123`

## Headers
Headers provide essential metadata for request processing:

### Common Request Headers
- Host: Target host and port number
- Content-Type: Format of sent data
- Content-Length: Size of request body
- Authorization: Authentication credentials
- Accept: Expected response formats
- User-Agent: Client application info
- Cookie: Session data

Example header set:
```
Host: api.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 128
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Request Body
The body carries data in various formats based on Content-Type:

### Types
1. application/json
   - Structured data in JSON format
   - Used for API requests

2. application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   - Simple key-value pairs
   - Default for HTML forms

3. multipart/form-data
   - File uploads
   - Mixed content types

## URL Parameters
Query parameters in the URL for data transmission:

### Structure
- Start with question mark (?)
- Use key=value format
- Join multiple parameters with ampersand (&)
- Must be URL-encoded

Example: `/search?query=term&category=books&page=1`

## 5. Server Processing
- Request arrives at the server
- Server routes the request to appropriate handler
- Application logic processes the request
- Database queries may be executed
- Response is generated

## 6. Response Journey
- Server sends HTTP response
- **TODO:**Complete the response journey
- Data travels back through the network

## 7. Browser Processing
- Browser receives the response
- If HTML, begins parsing
- Downloads additional resources (CSS, JS, images)
- Renders the page

**TODO:** Add details about browser rendering pipeline and critical rendering path

## Common Optimization Techniques
- Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
- Browser caching
- Compression
- Connection pooling

**TODO:** Add space and time complexity analysis for different caching strategies

## Error Scenarios
- **TODO:**Complete the error scenarios

## Security Considerations
- **TODO:**Complete the security considerations

**TODO:** Add detailed explanation of common security vulnerabilities and prevention techniques

# The Journey of a Web Request

When you type a URL in your browser and press Enter, a fascinating journey begins. Let's break down this journey step by step.

## 1. DNS Resolution
- The browser first needs to find the actual IP address of the server
- It checks various DNS caches (browser, operating system, router)
- If not found in caches, it queries DNS servers
- Finally gets the IP address of the server

**TODO:** Add explanation of DNS cache hierarchy and time complexity of DNS lookups

## 2. Establishing TCP Connection
- The browser initiates a TCP connection with the server
- This happens through the famous three-way handshake:
  - **TODO:**Complete the three-way handshake

**TODO:** Add details about TCP window sizing and congestion control algorithms

## 3. TLS Handshake (for HTTPS)
- After TCP connection, a secure channel needs to be established
- Client and server exchange certificates
- They negotiate encryption algorithms
- A secure connection is established

## 4. HTTP Request Formation
- Browser creates an HTTP request with:
  - **TODO:**Complete the request formation

**TODO:** Add common HTTP headers and their purposes

## 5. Server Processing
- Request arrives at the server
- Server routes the request to appropriate handler
- Application logic processes the request
- Database queries may be executed
- Response is generated

## 6. Response Journey
- Server sends HTTP response
- **TODO:**Complete the response journey
- Data travels back through the network

## 7. Browser Processing
- Browser receives the response
- If HTML, begins parsing
- Downloads additional resources (CSS, JS, images)
- Renders the page

**TODO:** Add details about browser rendering pipeline and critical rendering path

## Common Optimization Techniques
- Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
- Browser caching
- Compression
- Connection pooling

**TODO:** Add space and time complexity analysis for different caching strategies

## Error Scenarios
- **TODO:**Complete the error scenarios

## Security Considerations
- **TODO:**Complete the security considerations

**TODO:** Add detailed explanation of common security vulnerabilities and prevention techniques

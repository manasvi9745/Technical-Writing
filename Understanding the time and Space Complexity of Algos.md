Common Algorithms and Their Complexities

This document lists various algorithms and their time/space complexities. Some complexities are missing - can you help fill them in?

1. Linear Search
Description: Sequentially checks each element in a list until a match is found or the end of list is reached.
- Best case: O(1) (element found at the start).
- Worst case: O(n) (element found at the end or not found).
- Recursive space complexity: O(n) due to function call stack.


2. Binary Search
Description: Repeatedly divides a sorted array in half, eliminating the half that cannot contain the target value.
- Best case: O(1) (middle element is the target).
- Worst case: O(log n) (keep dividing search space).
- Recursive space complexity: O(log n) (recursion stack depth).

3. Bubble Sort
Description: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- Best case: O(n) (already sorted array).
- Worst case: O(n²) (comparing every pair).
- Recursive space complexity: O(n) (function calls).

4. Selection Sort

5. Insertion Sort
Description: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, by repeatedly inserting a new element into the sorted portion of the array.
Time Complexity:

6. Merge Sort
Description: Divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
Time Complexity:

7. Quick Sort
Description: Selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

8. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Description: Explores a graph level by level, visiting all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level.

Time Complexity: 
Space Complexity:


14. Fibonacci Sequence (Dynamic Programming)
Description: Calculates the nth Fibonacci number using a bottom-up approach with memoization.
Time Complexity: 
Space Complexity:


15. Matrix Multiplication (Naive)
Description: Naïve Matrix Multiplication follows the standard row-column method to multiply two matrices. 
** Time Complexity: **
- Best-case Complexity: O(mnp)
- Worst-case Complexity: O(mnp)

Since each element requires n multiplications and additions, the complexity remains O(mnp) in all cases.

** Space Complexity: **
- The space required to store the resulting matrix C is O(mp).

If auxiliary storage is considered, additional space is minimal, so the space complexity remains O(mp).

** Applications **
- Computer graphics transformations
- Scientific computing
- Machine learning and deep learning computations
- Engineering simulations

** Limitations **
1. Inefficiency: The naive approach is slow for large matrices due to its O(mnp) complexity.
2. Better Alternatives: Strassen’s Algorithm (O(n^{2.81})) and more optimized methods like the Coppersmith-Winograd Algorithm are used for faster computations.


Note: For each algorithm, consider:
- Best case scenario
- Average case scenario
- Worst case scenario
- Any space complexity variations based on implementation
